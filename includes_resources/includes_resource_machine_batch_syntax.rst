The syntax for using the |resource machine_batch| resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   machine_batch 'name' do
     attribute 'value' # see properties section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where 

* ``machine_batch`` tells the |chef client| to use the ``Chef::Provider::MachineBatch`` provider during the |chef client| run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available for this resource
* ``:action`` identifies which steps the |chef client| will take to bring the node into the desired state
